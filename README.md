# ST-558-Project-3

The purpose of this repo is to house all of the `files` and documents used in creating `Project 3`, which analyzes the `Diabetes Health Indicators`Dataset. A more detailed description is provided in the `Warren_Ellsworth_ST 558 Project 3.Rmd` file. 
The main thing to note is all analysis and modeling is done for each `education level`, which is itself a feature of the data set. That means there will be multiple reports for each education level. Along with the `.Rmd` file, which includes the code 
for the project, there are `5 .md` documents, one for each education level in the data set. Each of these documents were rendered as a `github_document` to produce the `.md` file. There is also a `.yml` file that gives a line of code corresponding to the 
`theme` of our github pages site.

In conducting our analyis and modeling, various packages were used that include: `tidyverse, scales, plyr, GGally, caret, MASS, and e1071`.

Lastly, below are `links` to each `.html` file of the generated analyses for each education level.
